# URL shortener
Node.js & Express

I was copying links to my github projects and thought, "Some of these are annoyingly long. I should make them shorter."
So instead of using an existing url shortener, I made one of my own.

Full and short url pairs are stored in a Postgres database.
Random four-digit alphanumeric strings are generated by Postgres. Only the four-digit string is saved as the short url (the first part of the shortened urls is always the same).
If an exact url has already been shortened by anyone, the short url will be retrieved and displayed to the user.
Postgres will ensure that all four-digit short urls are unique.
